# Computers Art Integrated Activity
 This is our group's Computers art integrated activity. This includes a program which displays all of the shapes that the members have done (`src/Main.py`), as well as individual code files in `src/code`.
 
 The program has some issues, and we're trying to fix that as soon as possible. If you encounter any issues with `src/Main.py`, please try changing the shape in the menu or please close it and open it again.
 
 The audio files used in this project are **not to be redistributed or used outside this program.**
